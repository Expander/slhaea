Requirements:
  To use SLHApp only the C++ Standard Library, the Standard Template
  Library (STL) and some headers from the Boost C++ Libraries[1] are
  required.

  Doxygen[2] is used for building the API documentation, CppUnit[3] is
  required to compile the unit tests and CMake[4] is used to build
  them. This is of course all optional.
