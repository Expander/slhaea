SLHAea - another SUSY Les Houches Accord input/output library
=============================================================

Introduction:
  SLHAea is an easy to use C++ library for input, output, and
  manipulation of data in the SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA). It is
  based on the concept that a SLHA structure is a container of blocks,
  which are then again containers of lines, which are then again
  containers of strings.

  Its main features are:
  - reading and writing SLHA files
  - easy access to individual blocks, lines, and fields
  - three containers (SLHA, SLHABlock, and SLHALine) that mimic the
    STL containers and therefore offer great flexibility
  - the exact formatting of lines is preserved
  - everything is stored as strings, so data is not restricted to
    doubles or ints
  - no precision is lost in read/write cycles of unmodified data
  - blocks and lines are not restricted to the ones specified in the
    SLHA/SLHA2

Documentation:
  The API documentation and some examples can be found here:

Dependencies:
  To use SLHAea only the C++ Standard Library and some headers from the
  Boost C++ Libraries[1] are required.

  For development of SLHAea Git is used. The SLHAea repository can be
  inspected and browsed online at GitHub[2] and it can be cloned by
  running[3].
