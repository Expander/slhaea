SLHAea - another SUSY Les Houches Accord input/output library
=============================================================

Introduction:
  SLHAea is an easy to use input/output C++ library for the SUSY Les
  Houches Accord (SLHA).

Documentation:
  The API documentation and a tutorial can be found here:
    http://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~fthomas/slhaea/

Dependencies:
  To use SLHAea only the C++ Standard Library and some headers from the
  Boost C++ Libraries[1] are required.

  Doxygen[2] is used for building the API documentation, CppUnit[3] is
  required to compile the unit tests, and CMake[4] is used to build
  them. But these software are not required to use SLHAea, they are only
  used for development of SLHAea.
